# World Weather Analysis

## Background

### Purpose

The "PlanMyTrip" app is updating the user experience to include the current weather description for destinations when searching for vacation locations based on maximum temperature preferences, allowing the user to filter their potential destinations. Additionally, improvements were made to enable users to choose multiple destinations and create a travel itinerary. A marker layer map is now provided for users based on selected travel destinations that includes Hotel Name, City, Country Code and Current Weather Description with the Maximum Temperature.
